  'Experiments Tool'

# Experiments
Experiments, or A/B tests, allow you to test different variants of a feature or game mechanic to see which one performs better. This is a powerful tool for growing your server, as just a 5% increase in retention or revenue resulting from A/B testing can be highly valuable. The Experiments tool makes it easy to create, manage, and analyze your experiments.

## Creating an Experiment
To create an experiment, click "Add new" on the Experiments page. The following fields are required:
- **Name**: The name of the experiment.
- **Server**: The server that the experiment will run on. Experiments can only run on one server to ensure that the results are not skewed.
- **Trigger**: The trigger that will start the experiment. This can be automatic, including user joins, first joins, and payments, or manual, including commands and PAPI placeholders.
- **Options**: Currently, the only option is whether users should always see the same variant.
- **Variant List**: Here, you can add variants to your experiment.

## Variants
A variant has the following properties:
- **ID**: The ID of the variant (automatically generated). This is used internally and for manual triggers.
- **Name**: The name of the variant. Make this descriptive so that you can easily identify which variant is which later on.
- **Probability**: The probability that a user will be assigned to this variant. The sum of all probabilities must be 100%.
- **Type**: The action type that will be performed if this variant is selected.
- **Value**: The value of the action. For example, if the action type is a command, the value would be the command that will be run.

## Actions
The following action types are available:
- **Control**: Does nothing.
- **Console Command**: Runs a command as the console.
- **Player Command**: Runs a command as the player.
- **Chat Message**: Sends a chat message to the player. Supports color codes.

## Available Placeholders
The following placeholders can be used in action values:
- **`%player%`**: The player's username.
- **`%uuid%`**: The player's UUID.
- **`%variant%`**: The variant ID.
- **`%experimentName%`**: The experiment name.

## Manual Triggers
Experiments with the `Command` or `Placeholder` trigger are manually triggered, usually by an external plugin.
Through the use of manual triggers, virtually any feature, gameplay mechanic, or other aspect of your server can be A/B tested.

### Commands
Note: When using commands, experiment names cannot contain spaces.

The `mcmexperiment <experiment name> <player name>` console command. This command will manually trigger an experiment for a player.

### Placeholders
Experiments can also be triggered through the use of [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) placeholders.

The placeholder format is `%mcm_[experiment name]%`. When executed, the following will happen:
1. The plugin will select a variant for the player and perform the action.
2. The placeholder will return the ID of the selected variant
3. The player's session will be linked to the variant (as if they were assigned to it through the automatic trigger)

Note: If the experiment does not exist, the placeholder will return `null`. If the trigger of the experiment is not `Placeholder`, the placeholder will return `ERR_PROVIDED_EXPERIMENT_NOT_PAPI_TRIGGERED`.

## Behind the Scenes: Consistent Variant Option
If the `Users should always receive the same variant (strongly recommended)` option is enabled, the plugin will use a simple algorithm to ensure that the same users will always get the same variant.

To make this work, when an experiment with the option is created, the browser client will generate a `variantsRandomlyOrdered` value. This is an integer in the database, such as:
```
312
```

Each number here - `3`, `1`, and `2` - is a variant ID. The order of the numbers is random, but consistent for the same experiment.

When an A/B test with consistent variants is executed, the server generates a random double between 0 and 100 based on the UUID - this is always the same for the same UUID:
```java
/**
     * Generates a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive based on the given UUID.
     * The output is random, but consistent for the same UUID.
     * @param uuid The UUID of the player
     * @return A random number between 0 and 100 inclusive
     */
    public static double getProbabilityFromUuid(String uuid) {
        String firstTwoChars = uuid.substring(0, 2);

        return ((double) combinations.indexOf(firstTwoChars) % 100) / 100;
    }
```

The server then creates a list of all variants including their probability, ordered by the order provided in variantsRandomlyOrdered. For example, if there are 3 variants:
- **Variant 1**: 20% chance
- **Variant 2**: 50% chance
- **Variant 3**: 30% chance

...and the random order is 312, then they will be ordered like this:
```
| 3 - 0.3 | 1 - 0.2 | 2 - 0.5 |
```

The plugin then loops through these variants using the random double generated from the UUID -- for example, with a randon number of 0.4, variant 1 will be chosen.

This algorithm the advantage that variants are still completely randomly chosen (because UUIDs are random), but still the same for each UUID.

## Experiment Results
You can view the results of your experiments at any time from the Experiments page by clicking the "View" button.

This will show you each variant with its corresponding name, probability, and the number of sessions that were assigned to it.

More importantly, it will show you a separate table showing the following metrics for each variant:
- Average Retention
- 5min/1d/7d Retention
- Revenue generated
- Average revenue per user

These metrics are incredibly useful for determining which variant is the best. For example, if you are testing a new feature, you can add multiple variants and see which one has the highest retention. If you are testing a new pricing model, you can see which one generates the most revenue.
