# Revenue Analytics

Explanation of every metric in the Revenue section.

- **Total Revenue/Total Revenue Chart:** The sum of all payments ever made to the server.
Historical data shows the sum of all payments per day over the last month.
Unlike most other metrics, this is cumulative and not a daily aggregation. (Identical to the metrics from the [User Activity](/activity) section)
- **Conversion Rate:** The number of unique users who have at least one payment divided by the number of unique users in general.
In other words, the percentage of users who end up making at least one payment.
If this is low, it means that users are not converting into paying users frequently and that you should improve marketing for your store.
- **Average Revenue Per User:** The average amount of money spent by a player.
- **Average Revenue Per Paying User:** The average amount of money spent by players who have made at least one payment.
- **Repeat Purchase Rate:** The number of users who have made more than one payment
divided by the number of users who have made at least one payment.
If this is low, you should improve your post-payment flow and ensure users reliably receive their purchased items.
- **Average Time To Purchase:** The average time between a user's first session and their first payment.

## User Flow Funnel
The user flow funnel displays the four most important milestones in the process of getting users to join first time to making multiple payments:
1. First Session
2. Second Session
3. First Payment
4. Second Payment

Each milestone displays the absolute number of events, and the percentage of users who have reached the milestone.
