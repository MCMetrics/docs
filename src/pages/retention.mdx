# User Retention

Explanation of every metric in the User Retention section.

- **5min/1d/7d/30d/60d/90d Retention:** The percentage of users who have sessions at least [time period] apart.
This also considers the session length; for example, if a user only has one session lasting 5 minutes, that will be counted as 5 minute retention.
- **Daily Player Retention Chart:** This chart shows the daily retention between 0 and 90 days inclusive.
The retention chart is a powerful tool for determining after how many days a player is likely to get bored and stop playing,
meaning you can adjust your game mechanics accordingly.
