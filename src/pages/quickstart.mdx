# Quickstart
Set up MCMetrics to start collecting data within 5 minutes.

## Create a Project
To get started, [create a new project](https://dashboard.mcmetrics.net/project/new). Add a name and optionally a description.

## Add a Server
To add a server, enter a name and select a server type. Valid server types are:
- Spigot: Supports [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/) servers (including paper and other forks)
- Velocity: Supports [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) proxies.
- Bungee Supports [Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/go/bungeecord) proxies.

Proxy setups require at least one spigot server in order to track sessions.
Read more [here](/proxy-setup)

## Plugin Setup
In the next step, you will get a plugin download link for the server type that you selected. Alternatively, you can download them here:
- [Spigot Download](/jars/mcm-spigot-1.0.0.jar)
- [Velocity Download](https://google.com) Not yet available
- [Bungeecord Download](https://google.com) Not yet available

The plugins are also [open-source](https://github.com/MCMetrics) and can
also be
compiled manually.

Add the `.JAR` file to your `/plugins` directory and restart the server. Once restarted, execute the `/mcmetrics setup` command provided in the setup step to automatically connect your server. Once completed, user sessions will automatically be tracked and uploaded.

## Revenue Tracking Setup
Optionally, you can set up revenue tracking to automatically track payments
made on your store. If you decide not to set up revenue tracking, you can still 

Revenue tracking works by executing plugin commands with payment information whenever a payment is completed.

- Tebex Setup: Add the following global command to each server: `mcmpayment tebex {id} {transaction} {price} {currency} {packageId}`
- CraftingStore Setup: Add the following global command to each server: `mcmpayment craftingstore {uuid} {transaction_id} {amount} USD {packages}`. CraftingStore currently doesn't have a placeholder for currency.
