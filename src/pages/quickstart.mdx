# Quickstart
Set up MCMetrics to start collecting data within 5 minutes.

## Create a Project
To get started, [create a new project](https://dashboard.mcmetrics.net/project/new). Add a name and optionally a description.

## Add a Server
To add a server, enter a name and select a server type. Valid server types are:
- Spigot: Supports [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/) servers (including paper and other forks)
- Velocity: Supports [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) proxies.
- Bungee Supports [Bungeecord](https://www.spigotmc.org/go/bungeecord) [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) proxies.

Proxy setups require at least one spigot server in order to track sessions.
Read more [here](/proxy-setup)

## Plugin Setup
In the next step, you will get a plugin download link for the server type that you selected. Alternatively, you can download them here:
- [Spigot Download](/jars/mcm-spigot-1.0.0.jar)
- [Velocity Download](/jars/mcm-velocity-1.0.0.jar)
- [Bungeecord Download](/jars/mcm-bungee-1.0.0.jar)

The plugins are also [open-source](https://github.com/MCMetrics) and can
also be
compiled manually.

Add the `.JAR` file to your `/plugins` directory and restart the server. Once restarted, execute the `/mcmetrics setup` command provided in the setup step to automatically connect your server. Once completed, user sessions will automatically be tracked and uploaded.

## Revenue Tracking Setup
Optionally, you can set up revenue tracking to automatically track payments
made on your store. Revenue tracking works by executing plugin commands with payment information whenever a payment is completed.

### Tebex Setup
1. Navigate to https://server.tebex.io/game-servers
2. For each server/gamemode you have, add the following Global Server Game Command: `mcmpayment tebex {id} {transaction} {price} {currency} {packageId}`
3. Click the Settings icon next to the command to edit the command options:
4. Set "Game Server to Execute on" to the server that command should execute on. Each command should execute on exactly one server.
5. Set "Execution Rule" to "Execute once per payment and not per package"

### CraftingStore Setup
1. Navigate to https://dash.craftingstore.net/admin/commands
2. For each server/gamemode you have, click "Create Command" with the following options:
- Command Type: `Initial`
- Server: Select the server that command should execute on. Each command should execute on exactly one server.
- Require player to be online: False
- Only execute when price is above: Leave blank
- Enter command: `mcmpayment craftingstore {uuid} {transaction_id} {amount} USD {packages}`
