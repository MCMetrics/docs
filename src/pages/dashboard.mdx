# Dashboard Guide

This page will walk you through the basics of the dashboard.

When you open the dashboard at https://dashboard.mcmetrics.net, it will automatically redirect you to
your project list if you have any projects the new project page if you don't have any projects.

## Projects vs. Servers
- Projects are a collection of servers, and generally represent a "network". For example, you could have a project "ExampleCraft".
- Servers are individual server instances, or gamemodes, such as "Hub", "Survival", etc.

## Metrics Page
Once you select a project, you can select a metric/tool category like "User Acquisition" or "Experiments".
Each of these will load a collection of metric cards related to that category.

## Metric Cards
A metric card, like the "Daily Active Users" card on the Overview page, will show you the relevant data for that metric. Things to keep in mind:
- Metrics are generally for the entire project, meaning they are aggregates of all servers in the project.
- Every metric has a question mark icon in the top right corner. Hover over this to see a description of the metric.
- Some metrics include historical data to compare against, including an area chart and a growth percentage. The growth percentage is calculated by comparing the current value to the oldest value shown in the chart.
