# Ad Campaigns

The Ad Campaigns tool is an incredibly powerful tool that automatically helps you
optimize your ad spend and return on investment from marketing campaigns.
This page will guide you through the process of creating and analyzing ad campaigns with the Ad Campaigns tool.

## What is an Ad Campaign?
An Ad Campaign is a marketing source that leads to players joining your server. Some examples include:
- Minecraft Server List Sponsored Slots
- Youtuber/Twitch/etc Sponsorships
- Organic Social Media Posts or TikTok Videos
- Any other marketing source that gives users a domain/IP to connect to your server

Importantly, every ad campaign is associated with a domain or subdomain.
This is the domain that players will be encouraged to connect to your server with, and will be used to track players per campaign.

For example, your server might have the domain `example.com` (but a wildcard subdomain `*.example.com` is also supported).
You might have 3 ad campaigns active:
1. **`youtube.example.com`** - You sponsored a youtuber to play on your server, and they posted a video with the domain `youtube.example.com` in the description.
2. **`serverlist.example.com`** - You sponsored a Minecraft Server List to have your server listed on their website, and they gave you a sponsored slot with the domain `serverlist.example.com` in the description.
3. **`tiktok.example.com`** - You created TikTok videos advertising your server, and you put the domain `tiktok.example.com` in the description.

In this case, the tool will automatically track users across these domains and give you vital insights on each campaign's performance.

## Creating an Ad Campaign
To create an ad campaign, navigate to the "Ad Campaigns" section of the dashboard and click "Add new".
Add a **name**, **subdomain/domain**, and an ad spend (the amount of money you spent on the campaign).

## Campaign Metrics
On the Ad Campaigns page, you will see key metrics on all of campaigns combined, as well as a table of all your campaigns and their performance.
- **Ad Spend**: The total amount of money you spent on the campaign.
- **Unique Joins**: The number of unique players that joined your server from the campaign.
- **Revenue**: The total amount of money you made from the campaign. This works by correlating the player uuids from payments to the player uuids that joined from the campaign.
- **User Acquisition Cost (UAC)**: The cost per unique join. This is calculated by dividing the ad spend by the unique joins.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: The cost per paying user. This is calculated by dividing the ad spend by the number of paying users from the campaign.
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: The average amount of money you made per unique join. This is calculated by dividing the revenue from the campaign by the unique joins from the campaign.
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: The return on investment from the campaign. This is calculated by dividing the revenue from the campaign by the ad spend from the campaign.

## Insights From Campaign Metrics
The Ad Campaigns tool helps you optimize your ad spend and return on investment from marketing campaigns.
For instance, if you notice that influencer sponsorships generally have a higher ROI than server list sponsorships, you can focus your ad spend on influencer sponsorships.
As a result, this tool can single-handedly save you thousands of dollars in ad spend and increase your revenue per dollar spent.
